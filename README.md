# dfa
DFA class project written in rust-lang

Goal is to confirm whether or not user-inputted strings are accepted by a given Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA).

The definition of the DFA will be stored in a .txt file. The program will consume the .txt file and will check if the string is compatible with the given DFA.

Install rust at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
To use the program, download it from the repo.
Open the directory while in the terminal.
Type "cargo build" to compile the executable.
Type "cargo run DFA-Test.txt" to run the executable.
